# Product Management

Product Management is all about building a deep understanding of a Product and its users. 

It is first and fore

- Why does the product exist?
- Who does the product exist for?
- What business outcomes does the product drive?
- What is the product roadmap?

### The Four Big Risks

- Value risk (whether customers will buy it or users will choose to use it)
- Usability risk (whether users can figure out how to use it)
- Feasibility risk (whether our engineers can build what we need with the time, skills and technology we have)
- Business viability risk (whether this solution also works for the various aspects of our business)



It's impossible to build a good product without great product management.
